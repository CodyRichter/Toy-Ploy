Work Done:
---------------------------------------------


Overview:
All of the scripts located in `Assets/Scripts` were created by us and us alone (the small exception to this is Guard and Looker which were made with help from https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/development/dotnet-development/creating-a-simple-ai-with-unity-and-c/ tutorial. We modified a significant portion of the logic within these files, but the base template came from the tutorial).
We collected all main game assets together and placed them in `Assets/MainGameObjects`



---------------
 Work Done Together
---------------
- Cody and Hannah created the tutorial level together
- Cody and Hannah both worked together on getting animations and animation controllers to work for both the player and the AI




---------------
 Cody's Work
---------------
- Cody created the level design for level 1 and level 2
- Cody implemented all of the audio in the game (Assets/Character/CharacterFunctions/Scripts/PlayerScripts/MoveBehaviour.cs, Lines: 89-90, 144-154)
- Cody worked on the base character controller and connecting it to the main game object
- Cody handled game logic of scene transitions, dying, and respawning
- Cody did a lot of work on the main game scene. These are all found in `Assets/Scenes`

---------------
 Hannah's Work
---------------
- Hannah created much of the game logic for the AI with the assistance of this tutorial: https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/development/dotnet-development/creating-a-simple-ai-with-unity-and-c/
- Hannah created a system to allow for easy additions of different AI toys that dealt different amounts of damage
- Hannah fine-tuned the AnimationController for the enemy AI
- Hannah fine-tuned the player character controller
- Hannah modified some of the physics in the player character to be more realistic for this game
- Hannah worked with the NavMeshAgents to allow for AI pathfinding
- Hannah created many of the menu screens. These are all found in `Assets/Scenes`
